cargo install flip-link
```

## Flashing and running the code

There are two ways, either you can use the picotool or probe-rs. The pciotool
requires less tools but you need to put the device into mass storage mode somehow.
probe-rs is easier to use but you need a debugger supporting swd and to solder the debug pins.
For details see the [cargo config](.cargo/config.toml).
